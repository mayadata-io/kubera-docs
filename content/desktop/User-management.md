User management plays a vital role in Kubera by controlling the resources being accessed by a user to perform his/her role and the actions they perform. The purpose of this component is to be able to manage the users having access to the Kubera dashboard.
<br><br>
You can perform User management by clicking on the “Settings” tab from the Kubera dashboard. Once you are inside the “User Management” screen,you can “Create users, manage them and reset their password and username” when required. Select the user for which you need to make changes, click on the “Edit Profile” tab
